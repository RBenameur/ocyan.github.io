                <p>Sea turtles are marine reptiles.They breath air in at the surface and can hold their breath through several hours of diving.<br><b>Food</b><br>Depending on the species sea turtles could be carnivores (meat eating), herbivores (plant eating) or omnivores (meat and plant eating). Sea turtles may eat algae, sponges and sea squirts.<br><b>Habitat</b><br>Most sea turtles migrate hundreds or thousands of miles between nesting and foraging grounds, where foraging mostly takes place on coral reefs.
                    <br><b>Size</b><br>Leatherback turtles, which are the largest of the 7 sea turtle species, can grow to 1.9 metres. Kemp’s ridley and Olive ridley, the smallest species, grow up to 75cm.<br>
                    <b>Life expectancy</b><br>Between 35-80 years. Although some individuals are known to have lived past 200 years.<br><b>Fun fact</b><br>Leatherback turtles can dive to depths of 1000 metres, in search of food.<br>Adult females return to land to lay their eggs after mating.<br><b>Why are they important to coral reefs?</b><br>
                    Sea turtles may eat algae, sponges and sea squirts which all compete with coral polyps for space, light and nutrients, helping to promote a healthy coral reef.
